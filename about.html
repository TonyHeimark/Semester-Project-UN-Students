    <p>Working Towards a Better Tomorrow
    Here at UN Student Association Oslo, we are driven by a single goal; to bring attention to important issues that impact our global society and ensure the preservation of the universal human rights for all. We strive to impact the world at large, by creating a sustainable world in which there is international solidarity, peace and cooperation.</p>

     </div>
     <div class="about2">

         <img src="images/sdg2-mini-min.png" alt="image of the 2. sustainable development goal."/>

    <p>Dealing with the challenges of today requires problem-solvers who bring different perspectives and are willing to take risks. UN Students Oslo emerged out of a pursuit to inspire and support the community, and a desire for actions to speak louder than words. As a voluntary student organisation, the UN Student Association Oslo are open for all students who are enrolled in higher education in Oslo and its surrounding vicinity - as we believe that the youth can initiate change.</p>

    </div>
    <div class="about3">

        <img src="images/sdg3-mini-min.png" alt="image of the 3. sustainable development goal."/>

    <p>Based in Oslo, we are an organisation driven by progressive ideas, bold actions, and a strong foundation of support. We organise member meetings, seminars, debates and social gatherings of various kinds in order to shed light on important issues we believe are worth discussing. At the very fundament of our organisation is the belief in a sustainable world in which the universal human rights are for all.

            <h4>Hamsika Premkumar</h4>
            <p>President</p>
        <div id="member1-text">
            <p>Hard-working, charismatic, trustworthy and joy-spreader - these are some of the words to describe our wonderful President, Hamsika. If it were up to us she would be President of the world. Currently, Hamsika is studying Medicine and Developmental Studies at the University of Oslo. As the president of the association she manages all projects, and has the responsibility of making sure everyone in the board does their part. In addition she is the one who calls the board and the members for meetings and decides the agenda of these meetings.</p>
            <p>Hamsika’s involvement in the association started in Bergen where she was the vice president of the UN Student Association Hordaland in 2015 before becoming the president in 2016. In January 2017 she moved to Oslo due to her studies. The UN Student Association Oslo was quite inactive when Hamsika arrived Oslo so she decided to do something about it by planning an event for the association that would attract a lot of students, which it did. At the end of the event she held an election, and the current board was elected.</p>

            <h4>Adela Sanchez Askeland</h4>
            <p>Vice-President</p>
        <div id="member2-text">
            <p>Nothing short of a girl boss, Adela is an inspiration to have on board and gets things done when it is needed. She definitely has a certain remarkable aura about her. Adela is studying Religion Studies, but from a Gender Studies perspective at the University of Oslo. As the vice-president she assists Hamsika in managing the association, and joins her in meetings with organisations we cooperate with. In addition she is an advisor, and helps Hamsika in everything she needs, which includes taking over the role of the president if Hamsika is not present. Lastly, she answers emails and messages from all social media sites.</p>
            <p>Adela is nothing short of an aspiring philanthropist with previous experience as a refugee guide with integration programmes at Grünerløkka School. For her the importance of being part of something that makes a real change naturally led her to the UN-Student Association Oslo as gender equality, human rights and intersectional feminism are core issues for Adela. </p>

            <p>Described as a joy-spreader with a positive attitude and charisma, Maria is a great addition to have to have on our team as she brings great energy wherever she goes. Maria is studying International Relations at the University of Oslo with an emphasis on social sciences. Maria’s job is to promote all the events, write some of the texts for the events, and create the events on Facebook. She is also the creator behind the official website having designed and written all of the texts by herself. In addition she is responsible for all of our social media outlets.</p>
            <p>With her previous experience from organisations such as The European Youth Parliament and Arbeidslivsutvalget ved Institutt for Statsvitenskap, Maria is certainly ready to tackle her role in the organisation. Having grown up in a multicultural environment, Maria is driven by the need to create a change and enforce empowerment for everybody as she believes in the importance of spreading knowledge. </p>

            <p>What is your favorite Sustainable Development Goal, and why? My favorite is quality education. I believe childhood is an important part of the development of an individual. Everyone must have a balanced childhood that consists both work and play in order to enjoy and contribute to the society.</p>
            <p>Why did you want join the UN Student Association Oslo? I wanted to develop my attentiveness towards others. I expected UN Student Association Oslo to be filled with diverse people, and I wanted to learn more by being in the midst of everything. </p>
            <p>Why should people attend UN Theme Week 2019? I think the significance of attending the UN Theme Week 2019 is that it allows one to simply engage. Some may be more knowledgeable, and some may be more interested. Conversely, some may be less knowledgeable, and some may be less interested. This is okay in my perspective. The fact that this event will be a platform which will enable people to interact with different ideas, meet new people, and ultimately expand their horizons simply makes this event worth attending.</p>

            <p>What is your favorite Sustainable Development Goal, and why?  Nr 17. This is my favorite since I believe that without a global collaboration there are many of the goals that can be harder to achieve.</p>
            <p>Why did you want to join the UN Student Association Oslo? I have always been interesse in the UN and I am a strong believer in a strong global cooperation. </p>
            <p>Why did you want to join the UN Student Association Oslo? I have always been interesse in the UN and I am a strong believer in a strong global cooperation. </p>
            <p>Why is it important for young people to engage and get involved in working towards a more sustainable and fair world? It is important because it’s we that are the future. We have the power to change the world if we want to.</p>

            <p>Treasurer</p>
        <div id="member7-text">
            <p>What do you study/what is your occupation? Asia and middle eastern studies with Arabic.</p>
            <p>What is your favorite Sustainable Development Goal, and why? All the SDGs are of course equally important but the SDG 16: Peace, justice and strong institutions, in my opinion, might be the first step to reach all the SDGs. If the world reaches peace, justice and ‘’A War-Free world’’ countries would probably focus on building cities solving the hunger problems, caring about the environment etc. instead of using the money they have on wars.</p>
            <p>Why did you want join the UN Student Association Oslo? Seeing the UN help immigrants had a huge impression on me since I was little, I've grown wanting to take a part in helping others, in making a change. Being a part of such an influential organization like the UN student association helps me to learn a lot and help make a change.</p>
            <p>Why should people attend UN Theme Week 2019? It’s a great opportunity for everyone who is interested in The sustainable development goals and the UN work. There will be some really interesting workshops, debates about the SDGs, not to mention the concert on the last day of the UN theme week. It will be an amazing week be there, you'll learn a lot and have fun at the same time!</p>

            <p>What is your favorite Sustainable Development Goal, and why? Goal number 17 is my favorite because we are all responsible.</p>
            <p>Why did you want join the UN Student Association Oslo? Because of the relevant experiences it would give me and because of the chance to meet new interesting people.</p>
            <p>Why should people attend UN Theme Week 2019? It will create and open up a network for you where you get to meet others with the same passion and interests as you! Off course, it will also be a great occasion for social gatherings and fun as well. </p>
            <p>Why is it important for young people to engage and get involved in working towards a more sustainable and fair world? I believe that young engagement and passion is unique! If we find a way to get our voices heard I have no doubt that youths are the ones who will change the world.</p>

            <p>Board Member</p>
        <div id="member10-text">
            <p>What is your favorite Sustainable Development Goal, and why? I think I would choose Goal 17: "Partnership for the Goals" because, in a way, it sums up the entire purpose of the SDGs. Each and every one of the goals needs to be achieved, and the only way to do this is with the cooperation of all parties and all of us working together.</p>
            <p>Why did you want join the UN Student Association Oslo? I first knew about them during the Associations Week at UiO. After going to the first meeting and event I thought to myself: "Here is a fun, cool, and diverse group of people that are interested in things I am interested too and that I can also relate to my studies... How awesome is that?!" </p>
            <p>Why should people attend UN Theme Week 2019?  UN Theme 2019: "Walk the Talk" will have all kinds of activities: workshops, debates, lectures, concerts, and even more cool events. So, because of all these different approaches, it is going to be a great opportunity for everyone to get to more about the SDGs.</p>
            <p>Why is it important for young people to engage and get involved in working towards a more sustainable and fair world? We must acknowledge, as early as possible, that sustainability comprehends different aspects of our life as human beings and our relationship with each other and with the planet. As Carl Sagan said many years ago: "A new consciousness is developing which sees the earth as a single organism and recognizes that an organism at war with itself is doomed".</p>
