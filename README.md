# Semester-Project-UN-Students

This was my semester project for the first semester in front-end development at Noroff. At this point we had just started to get varmed up using HTML5 and CSS3. Up to this point we mostly learned about design fundamentals, basic web and communication technologie and using Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop.
<br>

## The Assignment
The assignment was to make a new website for the UN- students Oslo association with the content provided from them. They wanted a clean, modern website which was easy to use and navigate compared to their old Wix site. 
<br>
<br>
1.	Create Gantt chart and start sketches/design for the website.
2.	Complete the graphic design for the website
3.	Start HTML/CSS development for mobile devices
4.	Develop CSS for laptop/desktop devices and perform simultaneous testing.
5.	Submit website, write report
<br>
<br>
### Requirements
<br>
1.	The site must be having a design that appeals to the target audience.

## Conclusion
I have learned a lot during this assignment. It was good practice to get content from the client, which was a little unorganized and messy, but I guess that’s how it is in the real world as well so that’s okay. 
<br>
This was also a great way to practice planning, I made a Gantt chart and followed it to some extent. I might have spent too little time planning the design, which came back to bite me later. If I were to plan this assignment again, I would make a more detailed mockup of the website before starting coding. I would also try to stick to my Gantt chart as much as possible. The time taken to finish different tasks was a little bit inaccurate, but learning to estimate time comes with experience, so I’m not worried. All in all, I am happy with how everything turned out and I feel like I learned a lot.
